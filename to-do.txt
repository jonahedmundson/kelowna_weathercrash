- merge weather and crash data into one .rda file

- make folders:
	- stats_scripts
	- rda_files
	- Reports
	
analysis --> breakdown trends by variable 

upon completion, make a tableau dashboard with key graphics from reports to stand alongside project (link from README)

upon completion, write an article about it on medium (towards data science)

use MLE w bootstrapping (581) to evaluate all model fits  --> or MSE from 571?

neural net approach --> what weather conditions create what crash outcomes? (multiple outputs)

make second dataframe --> combine to day total --> use daily weather conditions to predict daily number of crashes

nice visualizations --> https://www.tylermw.com/3d-ggplots-with-rayshader/
